Lambda Archiecture is fascinating Architectural Pattern. I first read about it while researching https://storm.apache.org/[Apache Storm]. Nathan Marz, the creator of Storm, discusses Lamda Archicture in his book http://www.amazon.com/Big-Data-Principles-practices-scalable/dp/1617290343/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1419944429&sr=8-1&keywords=nathan+marz[Big Data: Principles and best practices of scalable realtime data systems]. Here are some good resources for learning more.
