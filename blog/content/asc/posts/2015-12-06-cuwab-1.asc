My second grade teacher Ms. Cappabianca arranged comfy pillows in an
otherwise odd nook in her classroom and put the word cuwab on the wall
in funky construction paper letters. I remember it vividly even though
it was over 26 years ago. I remember excitedly rushing to claim the
best pillow before scanning the shelves to see if the Guinness Book of
Records was still available.

Did you http://duckduckgo.com[duckduckgo] cuwab yet? It does not exist
on the internet! Amazing. It is an acronym for **C**url **U**p **W**ith **A**
**B** ook, and I intend to do so once a week starting now.

Also, https://twitter.com/exupero[@exupero] inspired me to start
http://rohdesign.com/handbook[sketchnoting]. I bought a pad and few
pens and sat down for 45 minutes at the local library and drew out
notes to
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159143209X?keywords=remapping%20your%20mind&qid=1449451230&ref_=sr_1_1&sr=8-1[Remapping
Your Mind], a book I grabbed off the library new non-fiction shelf
last week when I was returning Felicia Day's excellent memoir
http://www.amazon.com/Youre-Never-Weird-Internet-Almost-ebook/dp/B00QNW8KR4[You're
Never Weird on the Internet (almost)].

Here is that sketchnote. I plan to sketchnote each weekly book. Follow
along to see how I do.
