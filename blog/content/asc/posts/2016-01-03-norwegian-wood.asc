Last week I read

Murakami]. Many friends and colleagues have recommended Murakami over
the years; however, this is the first of his I've read. Though I had
heard any good things about
http://www.amazon.com/Wind-Up-Bird-Chronicle-Novel/dp/0679775439/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1451867168&sr=1-1[The
Wind-Up Bird Chronicle] and

on the Shore] I decided to go with the more convential but less
Murakami "Norwegian Wood" not for any literary reason but simply
because that is what was available at the library and I love eponymous
song by The Beatles.

The theme of "Norwegian Wood" is responsibility: how responsibility
changes as we mature and our responsibility for the happiness of
ourselves and others. Murakami pays little attention the era of the
1960s, it seems as though the only reason for the novel's timeplace is
its relation to the author's own experience. But no matter, for at its
heart "Norwegian Wood" is a timeless coming of age love story.

I love quotations. I usually fill my notebook with them while
reading. I did not find a lot of quotations from "Norwegian Wood" but
the one's I noted are magical

____
I like you a lot ... like a spring bear.

and this exchange betweet the narrator Watanabe and his counterpoint Midori:

____
How much do you love me?  
  
Enough to melt all the tigers in the world to butter.

Murakami's power is in his figurative language, elegant dialog, and
unique lived-in worlds. I will smell the rain of Reiko and Naoko's
mountain retreat for months to come.
