# Ideas

I watched Luke VanderHart's [Building a Framework in Clojure](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/8717-arachne-building-a-framework-in-clojure) this morning.

# Takeaways

-   **Structural Frameworks** have benefits, which may be worth the costs if you buy in to the conceit.

-   Arachne's goals are:

    -   clojure

    -   rapid development

    -   shallow learning curve

    -   modular

-   Arachne answers the questions:

    -   What if my application was described in **data**?

    -   What if that data were stored in a **database**?

    -   What if that database had a **schema**?

-   Arachne introduces 2 ideas:

    -   application **concepts** *as* **configuration**

    -   applicaiton is a composition of 2 individually executable programs

        1.  configuration

        2.  runtime
