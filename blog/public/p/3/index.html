    <p>The first thing you notice when you read Seneca is we have changed little in 2000 years. Yes we've progressed from wax tablets to iPhones but apparently we've come no closer to solving our mind's traps than Stoic philosophers.</p><p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shortness-Life-Penguin-Great-Ideas/dp/0143036327">On the Shortness of Life</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger">Seneca</a> comprises three essays/letters written between 42 and 63 AD. "Consolation to Helvia" is a letter Seneca wrote to his mother shortly after his exile. Seneca alternates praising Helvia's courage with extolling the pleasantry of simple life. Exile is not bad, it is a gift.</p>

    <p>Last week I curled up with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312330537?keywords=shantaram&amp;qid=1450147384&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;sr=8-1">Shantaram</a> by Gregory David Roberts, a book <a href="https://twitter.com/tferriss">Tim Ferriss</a> mentioned many times on his podcast. I didn't know anything about the book when I found it in the fiction stacks of my local library. Shantaram is a story of prison breaks, thievery, acceptance, kindness, warmth, loss, lost, love, treachery, and war. It is a book about being free.</p><p>Loosly based on events in the author's life, Roberts' vivid descriptions of India, her life and culture, are the hearth of the book. The warmth emanates from Bombay's smiles, Sunder village's sustenance, the community of the zhopadpatti hutments, and Leopold's - Bombay's cousin to Rick's Cafe Americain.</p>

    <p>My second grade teacher Ms. Cappabianca arranged comfy pillows in an otherwise odd nook in her classroom and put the word cuwab on the wall in funky construction paper letters. I remember it vividly even though it was over 26 years ago. I remember excitedly rushing to claim the best pillow before scanning the shelves to see if the Guinness Book of Records was still available.</p><p>Did you <a href="http://duckduckgo.com">duckduckgo</a> cuwab yet? It does not exist on the internet! Amazing. It is an acronym for <strong>C</strong>url <strong>U</strong>p <strong>W</strong>ith <strong>A</strong> <strong>B</strong> ook, and I intend to do so once a week starting now.</p>

    <blockquote><p>The learning principle is to plunge into the detailed mystery of the micro in order to understand what makes the macro tick.</p><p>I've been recording "3 Things I Learned Today" off and on for the past year. I was inspired by Raju Gandhi's (<a href="https://twitter.com/looselytyped">@looselytyped</a>) NFJS talk "Learning to Learn" a few years ago. In May I gave a career day presentation to 7th graders at my wife's school and told them to start a "3tilt" (3 things I learned today) journal. The things you learn don't have to be traditionally academic: you could learn how to beat a difficult mission in Starcraft II or even the train schedule. The point of the exercise is reflection, gratitude, and continuous learning.</p><hr /><p><code>docker-compose</code> is a good tool for dev testing
... especially if you're travelling down the microservices route where your app has several external resources. A few recommendations when using <code>docker-compose</code>:</p><ol><li><p><code>image</code> &gt; <code>build</code> in the <code>docker-compose</code> configuration file: i.e. build the images for the app and its resources outside <code>docker-compose</code> and reference those prebuilt images from its configuration. Play around a bit, you'll see I'm right.</p></li><li><p>upgrade to <code>docker-compose</code> v 1.5.0 or greater so you can use variable substitution in your <code>image</code> references</p></li><li><p>remember that your links and environment are injected at <code>docker</code> "run" time, you can use the same images for testing and production with different environments</p></li></ol><p>create links between Elastic Beanstalk environments
... much like <code>docker-compose</code> allows you to create links between containers, Elastic Beanstalk let's you <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/environment-cfg-links.html">create links between environments</a>: simply create an <code>env.yaml</code> file in the root directory of your application (more precisely the root dir where you will call the <code>eb</code> cli) and follow AWS's always sensible randomized configuration file format.</p><p>stories are powerful
... I grabbed <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159143209X?keywords=remapping%20your%20mind&amp;qid=1448935799&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;sr=8-1">Remapping Your Mind</a> off the "New Non-Fiction" shelf of my local library when I returned Felicia Day's excellent memoir <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1476785651?keywords=felicia%20day&amp;qid=1448935874&amp;ref_=sr_1_1&amp;sr=8-1">You're Never Weird on the Internet (almost)</a>. I love the brain and usually read any book with the words "synapse", "mind", "neuroscience", etc. on the cover. This book makes a compelling case for the position stories in medicine. The authors use a plethora of techniques ranging from NLP to Native American spirit quests to help patients recover from acute medical conditions. A real testament to the power of the mind and the true physiology of the brain.</p><p>--  Josh Waitzkin The Art of Learning</p></blockquote>
