<meta name="description" content="The learning principle is to plunge into the detailed mystery of the micro in order to understand what makes the macro tick.I&#39;ve been recording &quot;3 Things I Learned Today&quot; off and on for the past year. I was inspired by Raju Gandhi&#39;s (@looselytyped) NFJS talk &quot;Learning to Learn&quot; a few years ago. In May I gave a career day presentation to 7th graders at my wife&#39;s school and told them to start a &quot;3tilt&quot; (3 things I learned today) journal. The things you learn don&#39;t have to be traditionally academic: you could learn how to beat a difficult mission in Starcraft II or even the train schedule. The point of the exercise is reflection, gratitude, and continuous learning.docker-compose is a good tool for dev testing
... especially if you&#39;re travelling down the microservices route where your app has several external resources. A few recommendations when using docker-compose:image &gt; build in the docker-compose configuration file: i.e. build the images for the app and its resources outside docker-compose and reference those prebuilt images from its configuration. Play around a bit, you&#39;ll see I&#39;m right.upgrade to docker-compose v 1.5.0 or greater so you can use variable substitution in your image referencesremember that your links and environment are injected at docker &quot;run&quot; time, you can use the same images for testing and production with different environmentscreate links between Elastic Beanstalk environments
... much like docker-compose allows you to create links between containers, Elastic Beanstalk let&#39;s you create links between environments: simply create an env.yaml file in the root directory of your application (more precisely the root dir where you will call the eb cli) and follow AWS&#39;s always sensible randomized configuration file format.stories are powerful
... I grabbed Remapping Your Mind off the &quot;New Non-Fiction&quot; shelf of my local library when I returned Felicia Day&#39;s excellent memoir You&#39;re Never Weird on the Internet (almost). I love the brain and usually read any book with the words &quot;synapse&quot;, &quot;mind&quot;, &quot;neuroscience&quot;, etc. on the cover. This book makes a compelling case for the position stories in medicine. The authors use a plethora of techniques ranging from NLP to Native American spirit quests to help patients recover from acute medical conditions. A real testament to the power of the mind and the true physiology of the brain.--  Josh Waitzkin The Art of Learning">
