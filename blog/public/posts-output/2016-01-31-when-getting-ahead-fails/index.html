    <p>My last post was 3 weeks ago. What happened? Why am I so behind? Because I ran ahead, stumbled, and fell out of my habit.</p><p>I have been reading at least a book a week for the past two months. 3 weeks ago I finished "Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman" mid-week, grabbed "A Thousand Splendid Suns" which I finished by Friday night. I was stoked! I had finished 2 books before the weekend. I write these posts before bed on Sunday night so I had plenty of time to do my #sketchnote and post. Only I wasn't.</p><p>I know that my favorite authors have posts in the can, that is they don't write every post the day they publish it. I was hoping to build a backlog of completed posts so that I would always have one to post on Sunday and I could sprinkle the rest throughout the week. However, I had not been writing every day, I had only been writing on Sundays. My reading workcenter was ahead of my writing workcenter. By finishing an extra book, I flooded myself with extra work I was not ready to handle. I was my own bottleneck!</p><p>What happens when a machine on the factory floor is overworked? It breaks down. Instead of making sure that I sat down to write every Sunday just to make sure I got something out the door, I patted myself on the back for doing extra reading and took a Sunday off. That was all it took to break my newly formed habit. That is the power of the process.</p><p>The good news is that I've kept up my reading and sketchnoting, though I've slipped 2 days on the sketchnotes. Back on the saddle. I'm writing at least every Sunday and I will get my sketchnotes done on Saturday so I'm not doing double duty on Sunday ... except for this week ... I need to finish my Sketchnote for "Hero with A Thousand Faces" by Joseph Campbell tomorrow.</p>
