I've always been nerdy (cereberal) and geeked (into) out on relatively
obscure pop culture when I'm feeling dorky. (Forthcoming post to describe the canonical
meanings of `nerd`, `geek`, and `dork`). In other words, I should have
played http://dnd.wizards.com/[Dungeons and Dragons] when I was
younger. But the wind finds the inner Grognard eventually. So when a
new work friend told me he was creating a world and assuming the
Dungeon Master mantle for the first time I downloaded the 300+ page
PDF of D&D rules 3.5 and rolled a Human Knight from a special order in
my friends world. We start in January and I'm stoked.

In honor of my first adventure I grabbed
http://www.amazon.com/Of-Dice-Men-Dungeons-Dragons/dp/1491514191[Of
Dice and Men] from my local library. It is an interesting book, half
narrative and half exposition, it tells the tale of the author David
M. Ewalt's refound love of D&D while recounding it's history.

Dungeons and Dragons is one of the most innovative games of all
time. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Gygax[Gary Gygax] and
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Arneson[Dave Arneson] met while
playing military strategy games in the 1960s. While both loved
wargames they knew something was missing. Both agreed that wargames
were too contricting, that a game where a player could create and _be_
a character hero was more powerful that acting a proxy for an army or
situation. Arneson added the "Dungeon" to host the adventure as well
as the idea of "leveling" up the player character. Gygax added the art
of storytelling and _Fantasy Game_ was born. The truth is that these
innovations gave birth to the video game industry in addition to every
other role playing game.

This book is a nice read for anyone interested in why people play
games or a history of D&D itself.
