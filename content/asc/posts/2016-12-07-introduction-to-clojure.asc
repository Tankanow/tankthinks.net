Today I gave this presentation to some new colleagues. I've given this presentation a few times over the past few months. I think people have found it useful, at least no one has said otherwise yet. =)

I'm not sure how useful it will be to you without my dulcet voiceover, but I share it here nonetheless.

Cheers,

Tank
