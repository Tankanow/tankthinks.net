{:title "5 Lamda Architecture Resources" :layout :post :tags ["architecture" "apache"] :toc true}

Lambda Archiecture is fascinating Architectural Pattern. I first read about it while researching [Apache Storm](https://storm.apache.org/). Nathan Marz, the creator of Storm, discusses Lamda Archicture in his book [Big Data: Principles and best practices of scalable realtime data systems](http://www.amazon.com/Big-Data-Principles-practices-scalable/dp/1617290343/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1419944429&sr=8-1&keywords=nathan+marz). Here are some good resources for learning more.

1.  [Runaway Complexity in Big Data and a Plan to Stop It](http://www.slideshare.net/nathanmarz/runaway-complexity-in-big-data-and-a-plan-to-stop-it) Nathan Marz great slide deck on reducing complexity in Big Data.

2.  [Nathan Marz on Storm, Immutability in the Lambda Architecture, Clojure](http://www.infoq.com/interviews/marz-lambda-architecture) Nathan Marz Q&A from QCon 2014.

3.  [Lambda Architecture: Design Simpler, Resilient, Maintainable and Scalable Big Data Solutions](http://www.infoq.com/articles/lambda-architecture-scalable-big-data-solutions) A great primer complete with working source code examples.

4.  [Implementing the Lambda Architecture with Spring XD](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/lambda-arch-spring-xd?utm_source=infoqEmail&utm_medium=WeeklyNL_EditorialContentArchitectureDesign&utm_campaign=12022014news) A nice presentation from SpringOne 2014 with multiple example implementations.

5.  [Questions About the Lambda Architecture](http://www.infoq.com/news/2014/09/lambda-architecture-questions) An interesting article summarizing some of the concerns about Lamda Architecture.
