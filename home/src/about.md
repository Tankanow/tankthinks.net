### Me

I've been programming since elementary school, when I discovered [HyperCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard) and made a [Calvin and Hobbes](https://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1992/10/11?ct=v&cti=1032876) trivia game. Here are some of the first principles I ascribe to:

- **Write Things Down**, you won't remember tomorrow.
- **Respect the Lindy Effect**: research ideas that have been useful for then longest time.
- **Understand the Domain**: the best code is the code that most clearly represents domain rules. Oh ... and by the way
- **Code is Liability**, write less of it whenever possible.
- **Don't Break Your Consumers**. 99% of the time, it is uncalled for.
- **Focus on Flow**. And not just _your own_ flow, focus on your teammates' flow. Move work to the right.
- **Take Long Walks** whenever possible. Don't listen to podcasts or music. Find trees.
- I am natural **Learner, Cultivator, Connector,** and **Arranger**.

I work remotely from my home in central Massachusetts.
