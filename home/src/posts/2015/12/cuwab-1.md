My second grade teacher Ms. Cappabianca arranged comfy pillows in an otherwise odd nook in her classroom and put the word cuwab on the wall in funky construction paper letters. I remember it vividly even though it was over 26 years ago. I remember excitedly rushing to claim the best pillow before scanning the shelves to see if the Guinness Book of Records was still available.

Did you [duckduckgo](http://duckduckgo.com) cuwab yet? It does not exist on the internet! Amazing. It is an acronym for **C**url **U**p **W**ith **A** **B** ook, and I intend to do so once a week starting now.

Also, [@exupero](https://twitter.com/exupero) inspired me to start [sketchnoting](http://rohdesign.com/handbook). I bought a pad and few pens and sat down for 45 minutes at the local library and drew out notes to [Remapping Your Mind](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159143209X?keywords=remapping%20your%20mind&qid=1449451230&ref_=sr_1_1&sr=8-1), a book I grabbed off the library new non-fiction shelf last week when I was returning Felicia Day's excellent memoir [You're Never Weird on the Internet (almost)](http://www.amazon.com/Youre-Never-Weird-Internet-Almost-ebook/dp/B00QNW8KR4).

Here is that sketchnote. I plan to sketchnote each weekly book. Follow along to see how I do.
