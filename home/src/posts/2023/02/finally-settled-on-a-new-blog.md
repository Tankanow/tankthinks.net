## Stack Overflow's Architecture

Interesting that this is a vertically scaled on-prem app. Amazing!

I poked through this thread. I didn't take a lot away from it. A good standard library is nice. I prefer Clojure's.

## Linux 6.2

Good to know. I haven't used Linux as my primary OS in some time. I use Mac at work and Windows at home for gaming.

## What to Expect from your Framework

I agree with most of the author's points. Like anything though, there is no panacea and the pendulum swings back and forth. After using Frameworks for a while, developers run into the "Wordpress Wall", and run screaming back to libraries.

Though I prefer the library approach, b/c you can always compose libraries into something bigger, I often yearn for a framework that will make the "easy things simple and the hard things possible".

## GoatCounter

I like the goals of the project. I recently removed all tracking JS from this site. I get any analytics I need from my CDN.
