# PWAA - Literal Data Structures

You probably take these for granted, giving them little or no thought; however, you must have used a traditional language without literal data structures before you realize their might. [This is how bad it can get](https://howtodoinjava.com/java/collections/hashmap/java-nested-map/).

What are Literal Data Structures?

## good
- novel
- concise
- easy to read

## warts
- tuples, trailing commas
- sets
- more immutable data structures
- dictionary?, who calls it that?

## filler
- JSON is not just for JS devs
- like pop music, there is something universal about it
