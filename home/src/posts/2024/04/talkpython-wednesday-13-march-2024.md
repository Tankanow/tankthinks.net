# [Talk Python to Me Wednesday March 13](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/453/uv-the-next-evolution-in-python-packages)

## Python Tooling

In September 2020, I [ranted a clickbaity yet honest diatribe](https://medium.com/tankthinks/3-reasons-why-python-developers-should-be-terrified-of-october-2020-ab942f5d0a4b) on changes to `pip`'s resolver.

My anger focuses on the idea that a resolver can decide the compatibility of dependencies by semantic versions alone. We cannot gaurantee avoiding conflicting dependencies. Even if we assume that all package maintainers perfectly (1) version their own libraries and (2) specify open dependency ranges on their transitive dependencies. I find `pip`'s suggestion to [](loosen the requirements of your dependencies)

## `uv`
