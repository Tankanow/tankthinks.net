# The Three Constraints of AI: Code, Servers, and Wallets

OpenAI is losing money on $200/month ChatGPT Pro subscriptions. Let that sink in. A company charging ten times what most SaaS products dare to ask is still bleeding cash on every user.

This isn't a pricing problem. It's a physics problem.

## The Productivity Paradox

Here's the uncomfortable truth: AI makes individuals more productive, which makes everything else worse. It's like giving everyone a Ferrari in a city built for horses.

When developers can generate 10x more code with AI, that code still needs to be:
- Reviewed by humans who read at human speed
- Tested by systems designed for human output
- Deployed through pipelines built for human pacing
- Run on infrastructure budgeted for human productivity

The Theory of Constraints tells us every system is limited by its narrowest bottleneck. AI doesn't eliminate bottlenecks – it relocates them and makes them more expensive.

## Constraint 1: The Code

GitClear tracked an 8-fold increase in duplicated code blocks. AI is turning our codebases into digital hoarder houses.

The code constraint has evolved into:

**Quality Chaos**: AI learned from the entire internet, including that Stack Overflow answer from 2012 that's definitely wrong but keeps getting upvoted.

**Attribution Anxiety**: When AI suggests code, where did it come from? We're shipping code we don't fully understand from sources we can't verify.

**The Mythical Man-Month Lives**: Brooks warned us 50 years ago that adding developers to a late project makes it later. Now we're adding AI developers that can't attend standup.

## Constraint 2: The Server

Remember choosing between t2.micro and t2.small? Simpler times. Now we have:

**GPU Hunger Games**: AI models need GPUs. Lots of them. Sam Altman complained their GPUs were "melting." If OpenAI can't keep servers cool, what chance do we have?

**Deployment Bottlenecks**: Your CI/CD pipeline was designed for human-speed code. Now it's processing AI-generated PRs faster than build servers can compile.

**The New Shared Services**: Every team wants their own AI infrastructure. Soon you'll need a service mesh just to track your service meshes.

## Constraint 3: The Wallet

In one report, every executive surveyed had cancelled at least one AI initiative due to cost. Every. Single. One.

**Stochastic Spending**: Traditional software has predictable costs. AI? A single query on advanced models can cost $1,000. That's not a service – that's a mortgage payment.

**Hidden Infrastructure**: The API call costs $0.02. But what about the vector database? The GPU cluster? The logging to debug why your AI told a customer to eat rocks?

**The Redundancy Tax**: Every team experiments. Every developer needs API keys. Without governance, you're not paying for AI – you're paying for AI waste.

## Critical Thinking Required

Successful AI adoption isn't about tools – it's about thinking. AI amplifies what you already have. If you have systems thinking, it amplifies that. If you have chaos... enjoy your amplified chaos.

We cannot offload critical thinking to AI. In fact, we need more of it than ever.

## Recognizing Your Constraints

**Code Constraint Symptoms**:
- PR queues growing exponentially
- "Nobody understands this code" becomes a daily item
- Git blame increasingly points to "AI Assistant"

**Server Constraint Symptoms**:
- Build times measured in geological epochs
- "It works locally" requires 64GB of RAM
- Deploy freezes because "the GPUs are busy"

**Wallet Constraint Symptoms**:
- Finance asks for meetings. Repeatedly.
- You start pricing everything in GPU-hours
- The phrase "burn rate" takes on new meaning

The irony? These constraints are interconnected. Solve one, the others worsen.

## The Path Forward

Theory of Constraints isn't just relevant in the AI age – it's essential. The winners won't be those who generate the most code. They'll be those who think systematically about constraints and build governance before they need it.

AI will supercharge your development. The question is whether it supercharges your productivity or your problems.
