# DevAIOps: A Call to Action for the Heroes Among Us

It's 2025, and I'm watching teams discover what happens when you give developers AI superpowers without AI super-governance. It's like Spaceballs merchandising: "Vibe Coding: The Flamethrower. The kids love this one."

I'm not here to take away the flamethrowers. I'm here to hand out fire extinguishers and suggest we practice somewhere other than the living room.

## The Heroes We Need

Remember early cloud adoption? When "lift and shift" meant copying your data center to AWS and wondering why your bill looked like a phone number? We survived that. We built DevOps, created FinOps, and turned chaos into competitive advantage.

Now we need heroes again. Not cape-wearing heroes (though I won't judge your WFH attire). We need heroes who see problems and think, "I can build a system for that."

AI is powerful, useful, and here to stay. ChatGPT has more users than most countries have citizens. The question isn't whether to use AI – it's whether we'll use it wisely.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

I opened this series with: "AI will not be productive by default."

Some people think that's anti-AI. They're missing the point. It's like saying a Formula 1 car won't win races by default. It's not an indictment – it's recognition that powerful tools require skilled operators and proper systems.

OpenAI losing money on $200/month subscriptions isn't AI failure. It's a preview of what happens when transformative technology meets reality. The reality where compute costs money, complexity requires governance, and physics still applies.

## The Critical Thinking Imperative

Howard Rheingold's phrase "Tools for Thought" captures what AI should be – not a replacement for thinking, but an amplifier of it. Mind augmentation, not mind replacement.

**We must not offload critical thinking to AI.**

I see it happening. Developers treating AI suggestions like divine revelation. Teams copy-pasting without comprehension. Organizations mistaking token generation for strategy.

Your AI doesn't know your business context. It doesn't understand your technical debt. It can't feel the pain of your on-call rotation. It's a brilliant intern with the world's knowledge but zero wisdom about your specific situation.

## Same Same But Different

Every "revolutionary" technology problem is just an old problem in new costume:

- **The Code Constraint**: Still about quality and maintainability
- **The Server Constraint**: Still about resources and scale
- **The Wallet Constraint**: Still about costs and ROI

The Mythical Man-Month is 50 years old and more relevant than ever. Physics doesn't care about your AI strategy.

## Extending the DevOps DNA

When I talk about applying DevOps principles to AI, I'm not suggesting we dust off old runbooks and change "server" to "model." I'm talking about evolving the DNA of these practices:

**From DevOps**:
- Version control becomes model and prompt versioning
- CI/CD becomes continuous training and deployment
- Infrastructure as Code becomes AI Behavior as Code
- Observability becomes token tracking

**From FinOps**:
- Cost attribution becomes token attribution
- Right-sizing becomes model selection
- Waste reduction becomes prompt optimization

These aren't analogies. They're blueprints.

## The Call to Action

Here's my challenge to you, the heroes among us:

**1. Be Intentional**: Stop treating AI adoption like a land grab. Build boring infrastructure before you need it. Create governance before the scary AWS bill.

**2. Think Systems, Not Tools**: Your AI strategy isn't about which model you use. It's about the systems you build around them.

**3. Create Feedback Loops**: AI without feedback is like driving with your eyes closed. Build checkpoints. Measure outcomes, not outputs.

**4. Share Your Learning**: DevOps succeeded because people shared. Your expensive mistake could save someone else a fortune.

**5. Remember the Humans**: Every line of AI code will be debugged by a human. Build your systems accordingly.

## Final Thoughts

The AI discourse is exhausting. It's either "AI will save us all!" or "AI is destroying craftsmanship!" We're stuck between vibe code evangelists and artisanal code purists.

A friend once said I give off Susan Powter vibes – well, here's me in full "Stop the Insanity!" mode. The DevOps movement succeeded because practitioners shared real experiences. We need the same for AI.

Because in the end, we're all in this together. And the only way through is to help each other build better systems.
