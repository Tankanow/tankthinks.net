# Introduction

In early July 2017, through a series of serendipitous events, I found out about a very early stage startup (pre-funding) and went to lunch with the founders, [Erik Peterson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erikpeterson/) and [Matt Manger](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattmanger/), in [Faneuil Hall](https://goo.gl/maps/qzVsDSLqpfp97o3r8). We connected. I had been dreaming about a startup for a while, so much so that I fell for the "startup-in-a-Fortune-100-company" sales pitch; and while I learned a lot during the 18 month gig at that Fortune 100 company, it was not my dream. Erik and Matt, the dreamer and the operator, had visions of (1) building the best company to work for and (2) designing a product that no company would choose to live without. A few weeks and a code sample later, on July 31st 2017, I joined [CloudZero](cloudzero.com) as a Founding Engineer.
