The learning principle is to plunge into the detailed mystery of the

I've been recording "3 Things I Learned Today" off and on for the
past year. I was inspired by Raju Gandhi's
(https://twitter.com/looselytyped[@looselytyped]) NFJS talk "Learning
to Learn" a few years ago. In May I gave a career day presentation to
7th graders at my wife's school and told them to start a "3tilt" (3
things I learned today) journal. The things you learn don't have to be
traditionally academic: you could learn how to beat a difficult
mission in Starcraft II or even the train schedule. The point of the
exercise is reflection, gratitude, and continuous learning.

.3 Things I Learned Today:

`docker-compose` is a good tool for dev testing:: ... especially if you're travelling down the microservices route where your app has several external resources. A few recommendations when using `docker-compose`:

. `image` > `build` in the `docker-compose` configuration file: i.e. build the images for the app and its resources outside `docker-compose` and reference those prebuilt images from its configuration. Play around a bit, you'll see I'm right.
. upgrade to `docker-compose` v 1.5.0 or greater so you can use variable substitution in your `image` references
. remember that your links and environment are injected at `docker` "run" time, you can use the same images for testing and production with different environments

create links between Elastic Beanstalk environments:: ... much like
`docker-compose` allows you to create links between containers,
Elastic Beanstalk let's you
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/environment-cfg-links.html[create
links between environments]: simply create an `env.yaml` file in the
root directory of your application (more precisely the root dir where
you will call the `eb` cli) and follow AWS's always sensible
randomized configuration file format.

stories are powerful:: ... I grabbed

Your Mind] off the "New Non-Fiction" shelf of my local library when I
returned Felicia Day's excellent memoir

Never Weird on the Internet (almost)]. I love the brain and usually
read any book with the words "synapse", "mind",
"neuroscience", etc. on the cover. This book makes a compelling case
for the position stories in medicine. The authors use a plethora of
techniques ranging from NLP to Native American spirit quests to help
patients recover from acute medical conditions. A real testament to
the power of the mind and the true physiology of the brain.
