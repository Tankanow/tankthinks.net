Last week I curled up with http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312330537?keywords=shantaram&qid=1450147384&ref_=sr_1_1&sr=8-1[Shantaram] by Gregory David Roberts, a book https://twitter.com/tferriss[Tim Ferriss] mentioned many times on his podcast. I didn't know anything about the book when I found it in the fiction stacks of my local library. Shantaram is a story of prison breaks, thievery, acceptance, kindness, warmth, loss, lost, love, treachery, and war. It is a book about being free.

Loosly based on events in the author's life, Roberts' vivid descriptions of India, her life and culture, are the hearth of the book. The warmth emanates from Bombay's smiles, Sunder village's sustenance, the community of the zhopadpatti hutments, and Leopold's - Bombay's cousin to Rick's Cafe Americain.

Here are some quotes I collected while reading the book.

____
Every day, when you're on the run, is the whole of your life.
____

____
and happy always has it good appetites.
____

____
I want everything ... the real trick in life is to want nothing, and
to succeed in getting it.
____
____
In your country, Lin, don't you know where the river stops?
____

____
The truth is there are no good men, or bad men ... it is the deeds that have goodness or badness in them.
____

____
Prisons are temples where devils learn to prey. Every time we turn the key we twist the knife of fate, because every time we cage a man we close him in with hate.
____
____
Every virtuous act is inspired by a dark secret.
____

____
If we envy someone for all the right reasons, we're halfway to wisdom.
____

Here is my sketchnote for the book, based mainly on these quotes and the theme of freedom.
