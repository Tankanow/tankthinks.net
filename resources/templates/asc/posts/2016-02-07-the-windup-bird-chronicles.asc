Wind-Up Bird Chronicle] is a twisting dream from Haruki Murakami. A
series of odd phone calls and the disappearance of a cat signal
change, though Toru Okada doesn't realize it yet. When his wife Kumiko
doesn't come home one day, Toru is forced to search for the
source. His journey takes him into a literal deep well of dreams to
find and return his life to normal.

My life has been nothing more than a convenient passageway.

I love this book. Even translated from the source Japanese, the
language is beautiful. Murakami's characters are colorful. Many scenes
stirred me to react physically. The story takes us through a
dream labyrinth without losing us in its corridors. It is one of the
best book of dreams I've encountered.

This book captured the soul of much of the Japanese media I've consumed over the
years, reminding me the most of the anime adaptation of
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welcome_to_the_N.H.K[Welcome to the
N.H.K.] Toru reminded me of the lonely Hikikomori, pulling inward to
resolve the confusing torments of social life. There are even a few
references to the NHK broadcaster contributing to Toru's strife.

I finished it and was
immediately obliged to reread it. For one thing I did not wish to exit
its atmosphere. But also, the ghost of a phrase was eating at
me. Something that untied a neat knot and let the frayed edges brush
against my cheek as I slept.

I agree. In fact, as I write this, I am picking at one of those untied
knots, gaining a deeper understanding of the universe a just left. I
recommend you go down the well.
