by https://twitter.com/avantgame[Jane McGonigal] is:

____
You are stronger than you know. You are surrounded by potential
allies. You are the hero of your own story.
____

Jane weaves the narrative of her own post-concussion recovery story
with scientifically proven benifits of living a gameful life in the
inspiring SuperBetter. What does it mean to be gameful?

____
Being gameful means bringing the psychological strengths you naturally
display when you play games - such as optimism, creativity, courage,
and determination - to your life.
____

The book comprises three parts: the first explains, in scientific
detail, the benefits of games; the second describes SuperBetter The
Game, a framework for living life gamefully; the final part gives
three example adventures that the reader can tackle right now.

I love that this book is actionable. Jane sprinkles quests - little
asides that can and should be completed as you go - that give the
reader the feeling of "levelling up" as he progresses through the
book. When I came across the first quest I started to get nervous: I
was reading the book on the train and I was afraind I would have to
get up and do something embarassing in front of my fellow
commuters. Fortunately I didn't but the book asks you to make a
decision right then - are you playing? 

____
If you want to quit something, anything, just solve a puzzle.
____

The reader cannot deny the power of games. Games have been shown to
help with https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ptsd[PTSD], anxiety,
and depression. Games can help you quit bad habits and even help with
chronic pain. You can find social fulfillment through games with
friends and family and even strangers. In fact, games help strengthen
empathy:

____
Modeling reciprocity means showing other people that we care about
them and that hey can trust us to offer help.
____


Reminding yourself that you are the hero of your own story build
self-efficacy, the key to unlocking the doors that cage us in doubt,
anxiety, procrastination, regret, and unhappiness. It helps us live a
calm and connected life full of resiliencea and reward.

How do you do all this? Simply play games with a purpose. SuperBetter
will help you do just that.

SuperBetter reminded me of one of my favorite books
http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307887448?keywords=ready%20player%20one&qid=1455587727&ref_=sr_1_1&sr=8-1[Ready
Player One]. It's as if I am a hero grunter. Except instead
of leveling up to search for easter eggs to save the OASIS from
corporate greed, I am leveling up to live a happy, healthy, productive
life. Awesome.
